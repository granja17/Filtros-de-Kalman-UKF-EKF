Robotics Movement Prediction using Data Fusion

This repository contains the implementation of data fusion techniques to predict the movement of a robot using Kalman Filters, specifically the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). This project was developed as part of my Master's coursework in Engineering and Data Science.

Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to accurately predict the trajectory of a robotic unit using advanced data fusion methods. By integrating readings from various sensors and applying Kalman Filter techniques, this implementation seeks to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the robot's predicted movement paths.

Features:
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF): Linearizes about the current mean and covariance.
Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF): Uses a deterministic sampling technique to capture the mean and covariance accurately for non-linear models.
